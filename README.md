<h2>Data Preprocessing and CLeaning</h2>
<p>Intial data had emoji symbols which could not add much value to our analysis. So in Data Cleaning I removed all the emojis and saved them as Iphone_Primary_clean.csv file</p>
<p>In the second phase we had cleaned the data more efficiently by removing few columns : reviewDescription, reviewUrl, reviewedIn</p>
<p>In the third phase I had modified the variant column into two separate columns : Color and Size. Deleted the variant column as well.</p>
